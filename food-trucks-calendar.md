   #### Describe the problem you'd like to solve
   
   Small independent food businesses like food trucks often do pop-ups / cafe residencies when they're just starting out, and it's hard to keep track of where they're going to be! 🚚 
   
   This ideas is basically to track upcoming pop-ups from food businesses in your area, and to give a central place for business owners to advertise their whereabouts. 
   
   #### Who are the stakeholders?
   
   - Small business owners
   - Local food lovers
   
   #### Other considerations
   
   This could include a calendar, map, crowd-sourcing information, company profiles etc. 📆 🗺️
   
   #### What is currently being done to solve this problem?
   
   Businesses normally advertise their own whereabouts, and struggle to attract new customers because this involves advertising to only the people who are already most interested in them. 
   
   #### What technology might be interesting to explore?
   
   This project could possibly involve integrating some sort of real-time tracking/geolocation too, like [this project](https://github.com/fac19/week11-where-is-whippy/).
