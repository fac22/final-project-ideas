# Final Project Ideas

### Ideas

Have a think about what might be a good project for the final few weeks of FAC22. 

- What technology might be interesting to explore? 
- What product might tie together your learnings from the course?

If you have an idea, add a markdown file to this repo, outlining the idea and what might be the achievable learning outcomes of the project.
